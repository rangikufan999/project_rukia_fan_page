		<p>Welcome to the about section on the Rukia fan page. I made this website because I am a fan of this character and I wanted to work on a page that used pure HTML and CSS. Everything is done with basic html and css. The site is responsive as well, working on both mobile devices and 4k monitors. Below I posted a snippet of history on Rukia's character as well. Please enjoy!</p>

		<p>Rukia meets Ichigo in the midst of a hollow attack. After suffering her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves.[12] While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others.[13] Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings.[14] Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling.[15] During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society.[16] They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.[17]</p>

<p>During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as an infant and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana initially tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia.[18] As Rukia grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family.[19] One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her.[18] When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him.[20] During the course of a mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him.[20]</p>


<p>Rukia using the "first dance, white moon" ability of Sode no Shirayuki's shikai.
During Rukia's bid for freedom, she is stopped by Sōsuke Aizen and his accomplices. Aizen, having singlehandedly orchestrated Rukia's execution, reveals to her that within her soul is stored the Hōgyoku ("breakdown sphere"), a powerful artifact created and placed there by Kisuke Urahara that gives hollows Soul Reaper powers and vice versa. Wanting the Hōgyoku for himself, Aizen hoped that her death would give him access to it, but settles for a nonfatal alternative.[21] The Hōgyoku is removed from her body, Aizen and his men flee Soul Society, and Rukia is acquitted of all charges.[22] With the Hōgyoku, Aizen is able to create an army of arrancar, which he uses to attack Ichigo and his friends once they return to the human world. Rukia and a group of other Soul Reapers are sent to assist in fighting the arrancar,[23] though after Aizen captures Orihime Inoue they are recalled to Soul Society.[24] Rukia's zanpakutō, Sode no Shirayuki (袖白雪, literally "Sleeved white snow"),[25] is also revealed as a completely white blade, earning it the recognition as the most beautiful zanpakutō in Soul Society.[26] Sode no Shirayuki utilizes ice to attack, each of its abilities being labeled as "dances" by Rukia.[25][27] During the anime's 13th season, Sode no Shirayuki manifests in a yukionna-like form, voiced by Mie Sonozaki.[28]</p>

<p>After learning that Aizen kidnapped Orihime, Rukia and friends head for Hueco Mundo to rescue her.[29] While there, Rukia encounters the Espada, Aaroniero Arruruerie, who is revealed to have possession of Kaien's body. Saddened that she had not saved her mentor from the control of a hollow as she had previously thought, Rukia manages to kill Aaroniero.[30] Rukia is badly injured during the battle, and it is not until Soul Society sends reinforcements to Hueco Mundo that she is revived and her wounds are healed.[31] She later assists Ichigo in his rescue to save Orihime from the Espada Ulquiorra Cifer by engaging the remaining Arrancars until requiring support.[32] Following Aizen's defeat and the loss of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers, Rukia and Ichigo bid one another farewell as Ichigo loses the ability to sense Rukia's presence.</p>

<p>Seventeen months later, Rukia, now lieutenant of Squad 13, returns to aid in restoring Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers before engaging the Fullbringer Riruka Dokugamine. When the Soul Society is abruptly invaded by the Wandenreich, an organization made up of Quincy who has survived their genocide one thousand years before, Rukia senses Byakuya being left near dead by Äs Nodt and is knocked out before she can come to her brother's aid. Rukia is taken to the Royal Dimension so she could be healed, and is then taught by Ichibei Hyosube to achieve her bankai, Hakka no Togame (白霞罸, literally "Censure of the white haze"). Returning to the Soul Society when the Wandenreich resume their attack, Rukia utilizes her newly acquired bankai to finally kill Äs Nodt. In the subsequent battles against Yhwach's Schutzstaffel Rukia and a large number of high rank Soul Reapers are quickly defeated by the powerful Gerard Valkyrie.</p>

<p>Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Rukia becomes the captain of the 13th Division, she and Renji are married and have a daughter named Ichika.</p>
